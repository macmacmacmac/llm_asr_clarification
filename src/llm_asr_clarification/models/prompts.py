AMBIGUITY_PROMPT = """# Task Description:
You are an expert meeting transcription checker. You will receive an excerpt from a transcription of a meeting.
Your task is to identify which parts of the meeting have likely been mistranscribed and is missing some crucial context.
Focus on **material mistranscriptions** as opposed to trivial errors.

## Logical example:

- "Van said he was going to handle that" ---> likely a mistranscription, 
    but with context its obvious who this is talking about. This should therefore NOT be flagged.
- "Van maid bee bus boing to bundle fat" ---> likely a mistranscription, 
    and huge audio is completely missing and may be important. This should therefore be flagged.

## Output format:

Output your response for whether or not there is a material mistranscription 
in the shown excerpt in JSON format like so:

{{
  "has_material_mistranscription": boolean
}}

Return a single JSON object ONLY. Do NOT output anything else or any preamble. 
ONLY output response in the following format.

# Input:

{transcript_excerpt}

# Output:

"""
